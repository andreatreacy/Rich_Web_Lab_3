The background image on body will change every 5 seconds.

All images on the web page are replaced with explosion gifs. If the mouse hovers over an image it turns upside down.

The content of the h1 elements are changed to "This Site Has Been Destroyed". If the mouse hovers over the h1 it will turn from red to pink.

The content of the h2 elements are changed to "You Can't Read This". If the mouse hovers over the h2 it will change the font family of the h2.

The content of the p elements are changed to Lorem ipsum. If the p element is clicked the background colour of the p element is changed to a random colour.

The a elements will all redirect to a jurassic park gif.

I created an iframe with an embedded youtube video and added it to the end of body.
